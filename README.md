# Home-work-AWS

First I visited the Cloud Academy web site and study about the lab sessions under AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate module.And also view videos and practically done it using Amazon web service.For that First I created a Amazon account and after login to it.After that I go through these actvities step by step.


*1.Lab Lesson 1  Create your First Amazon EC2 instance(Linux)_Part 1*

Amazon EC2 is the most famous AWS service and allows users to launch different types of cloud instances and pay for them with a pay-per-use approach. EC2 provides users with complete control of  computing resources and lets  run on Amazon’s computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes. This allows user to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, according to their computing requirements change. Furthermore it allows  to build and configure  instances as you like, from your operating system to your applications.

Lab Lesson 2  Create your first Amazon EC2 instance (Winodows)

Amazon EC2 is the most famous AWS service and allows you to launch different types of cloud instances and pay for them with a pay-per-use approach. With Amazon EC2 you can create new servers in a few minutes and use different images (AMI) to personalize them. AWS provides several Microsoft Windows Server AMIs that enables you to run any compatible Windows-based solution. You can use Windows-based applications, websites, and web-services written in .NET, for data processing, media transcoding, and any other task requiring Windows software.

Lab Lesson 3  Managing instance volume Using EBS

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.  Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect you from component failure. This provides high availability and durability. Amazon EBS volumes offer consistent, low-latency performance needed to run your workloads.

During this laboratory, you will learn to create an EC2 instance with an additional EBS volume. You will learn to attach and detach an EBS to/from a specific EC2 instance, take a snapshot, and master how to delete a volume.

Lab Lesson 4 Create your first Amazon S3 bucket

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), provides secure, durable, and highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. You'll pay only for the storage you actually use with no minimum fee and no setup cost. It can be used alone, or together with other AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), and Amazon Glacier. You can also use Amazon S3 with third-party storage repositories and gateways.

Lab Lesson 5 Create an EBS-Backed (Linux AMI)

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an EC2 instance. You can customize an EC2 instance and then save the configuration as a custom AMI for your private or public use. Every EC2 instance launched selecting the customized AMI will contain any software or file that you've previously added.

During this lab, you will setup a webserver EC2 instance starting from a Linux AMI, and then generate a new AMI.

Lab Lesson 6 Create your first Amazon RDS Database

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. You can migrate existing applications and tools that utilize a relational database to the Amazon Web Services because Amazon RDS offers access to the capabilities of a MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and the PostgreSQL database engine. Amazon RDS provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks. This efficiency frees you to focus on your applications and business.
